//             their customers; a customer sees the groups they belong to.
//   - Create/Delete: admin only.
//   - Update: admin (any field) or agent (collection fields only — when an agent
//             records a member's monthly contribution the group's running totals
//             and status are updated).
//   Customers can never write chit groups.
//
// This controller also serves ?table=chit_schedules, because a group and its
// draw sheet are edited together and carry the same permissions.
