<?php
// Loans CRUD with role enforcement:
//   - Read:   admin sees every loan; an agent sees only the loans assigned
//             to them (AgentScope); a customer only their own.
//   - Create: admin only (a loan_number is auto-filled if the client omits one).
//             Loan origination is an underwriting decision, so the agent panel
//             has no Create Loan button and the POST is rejected here too.
//   - Update: admin or agent — this also covers the real-time schedule sync that
//             rewrites a loan's outstanding_balance/status after each collection,
//             which is why agents must keep PATCH.
//   - Delete: admin only.
//   Customers can never write loans.
