// Collections (loan repayments) with role enforcement:
//   - Read:   a customer sees only their own receipts; an agent sees the
//             collections on their loans plus any they took themselves.
//   - Create/Update: admin or agent (field agents record payments).
//   - Delete: admin only.
//   Customers can never write collections.
//
// Every write also recalculates the affected loan(s) via LoanRecalc before the
// response is sent, so the repayment schedule, outstanding balance and monthly
// interest in the database are correct the moment a payment lands — no matter
// which client wrote it.
